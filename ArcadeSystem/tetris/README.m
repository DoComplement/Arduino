Tetris game using Arduino software (update this with pics and presentation stuff for a better introduction)

Things to improve:
  - improve the color scheme for objects and their shadows (how so?)
  - adding a table to hold the colors of each cell so when rows are cleared, the proper color is retained
  - increasing the quantity of the time that is decreased from the respective periods when a row is cleared
  - improve the sequence that objects are randomly generated ..?
  - scoring (quantity of rows cleared before failure)
    - add scoring -> current high score, best score
